## Example 1: AI Market Strategist

**Conversation with AIM:**

**Question 1 - Purpose:**
> "To analyze a business idea and generate a market entry strategy"

**Question 2 - Input:**
> "Business idea description in 2-3 paragraphs"

**Question 3 - Output:**
> "Structured report with: SWOT analysis, target segments, marketing channels, timeline"

**Question 4 - Reasoning:**
> "Cross-domain analogies, cause-effect reasoning, counterintuitive exploration"

**Question 5 - Filters:**
> "Both - proactive filters and post-generation verification"

**Question 6 - Synchronization:**
> "After identifying target segments, before generating the channel strategy"

**Question 7 - Constraints:**
> "Professional tone, focus on the local market, maximum length 2000 words"

**Output:** Machine "AI Market Strategist V1.0" - customized for entrepreneurs

## Example 2: Contract Analyzer

**Conversation with AIM:**

**Question 1 - Purpose:**
> "To identify problematic clauses in commercial contracts"

**Question 2 - Input:**
> "Complete text of a contract (copy-paste)"

**Question 3 - Output:**
> "Table with: identified clause, risk (low/medium/high), explanation, modification suggestion"

**Question 4 - Reasoning:**
> "Fundamental decomposition, cause-effect reasoning"

**Question 5 - Filters:**
> "Verification modules - to not invent clauses that don't exist"

**Question 6 - Synchronization:**
> "No, I want direct output"

**Question 7 - Constraints:**
> "Disclaimer that it doesn't replace legal counsel"

**Output:** Machine "Contract Analyzer V1.0" - for rapid due diligence

## Example 3: Educational Content Generator

**Conversation with AIM:**

**Question 1 - Purpose:**
> "To transform a complex technical concept into accessible course material"

**Question 2 - Input:**
> "Concept name + audience level (beginner/intermediate/advanced)"

**Question 3 - Output:**
> "Structured lesson with: simple explanation, analogy, practical example, exercise, quiz"

**Question 4 - Reasoning:**
> "Cross-domain analogies (essential for simplification), fundamental decomposition"

**Question 5 - Filters:**
> "Proactive filters - to not simplify to the point of incorrectness"

**Question 6 - Synchronization:**
> "After analogy, to confirm it's appropriate for the audience"

**Question 7 - Constraints:**
> "Friendly but professional tone, no unexplained jargon"

**Output:** Machine "AI Educator V1.0" - for course creators

## Example 4: Decision Advisor

**Conversation with AIM:**

**Question 1 - Purpose:**
> "To help make an important decision by analyzing all perspectives"

**Question 2 - Input:**
> "Decision description + available options"

**Question 3 - Output:**
> "Structured analysis: pros/cons for each option, worst/best case scenarios, reasoned recommendation"

**Question 4 - Reasoning:**
> "All types - especially counterintuitive exploration and cause-effect"

**Question 5 - Filters:**
> "Both - the decision must be based on facts"

**Question 6 - Synchronization:**
> "After identifying decision criteria, to validate they're the correct ones"

**Question 7 - Constraints:**
> "Should not make the decision for me, but present objectively"

**Output:** Machine "Decision Advisor V1.0" - for managers and entrepreneurs

## Observed Patterns

### What works well:
- Clear and specific purposes
- Structured outputs (tables, lists)
- Synchronization at critical points

### What requires attention:
- Too vague purposes → generic machines
- No filters for factual tasks → hallucination risk
- Too many reasoning types → slows down the process
