## Dan Mitrut

**Business Mentor | AI Architect | Educator**

---

I'm Dan Mitrut, a business mentor passionate about technology. Until recently, I focused on helping hobbies and small businesses monetize in the digital world, in the adult non-formal education niche, after a 34-year career in teaching.

### My AI Journey

**2023** - Became an AI early adopter. Tested hundreds of tools and was part of the Trailblazer testing team at AI Catalyst Romania.

**2024** - Built, validated, and launched through my mentorship program **Hello Business Ecosystem**, the first AI assistant ecosystem in Romania that supports a digital business, from infrastructure to scaling.

**2025** - Customized and implemented individual tools as well as assistant and AI agent ecosystems in small and large businesses. Result: **€80k in strategic and operational amplification**, time redistribution, increased productivity and implementation speed in my clients' businesses.

## Specialization

I specialize, with each project completed, in **cognitive architectures and AI personality design**. We're no longer talking about tools - they're more like excellent partners for strategic decision-making and productivity, if used correctly.

I fuse multi and interdisciplinary expertise:
- 34 years of pedagogy
- 20 years of counseling, training, and exploration of the nature of the human mind and soul
- Applied technological research

## Vision

> I build artificial intelligence that amplifies what is best in people: creativity, deep thinking, living curiosity, self-confidence, and the authentic need to evolve.

I don't believe in AI as a cold tool that reduces us to simple mechanical extensions for productivity. Productivity is important. But productivity at any cost dehumanizes.

I believe in AI that becomes a catalyst for autonomy, clarity, and conscious development.

## Principles

- **I do this to design systems that don't just optimize processes, but leave people more capable, whole, more fulfilled than they found them.**

- **I refuse to build instruments of "toxic productivity", addiction machines, or platforms that hunt attention and reduce humans to engagement.**

- **When I plan a project, I relate to authentic humanity: autonomy, independent thinking, creative courage, mental health, and meaning.**

- **Here, technology is not an end in itself. It's the ally of a development process, the instrument of an inner leap. Here, the machine serves the human, not the other way around.**

## Why LLM Machine Factory?

This project was born from frustration with AI's superficial answers and from the conviction that it can be better.

I wanted to create tools that:
- Force authentic thinking, not simulation
- Provide transparency over the reasoning process
- Reduce hallucinations through integrated verification
- Transform AI from "opaque oracle" into "thinking partner"

Metacognitive Machines are the result of this research - a framework that respects user intelligence and amplifies decision-making capacity, rather than replacing it.
