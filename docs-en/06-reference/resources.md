## Theoretical Foundations

### Chain of Thought Prompting
- **Paper:** "Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models" (Wei et al., 2022)
- **Key idea:** Forcing LLMs to show their reasoning steps significantly improves accuracy

### Tree of Thought
- **Paper:** "Tree of Thoughts: Deliberate Problem Solving with Large Language Models" (Yao et al., 2023)
- **Key idea:** Exploring multiple reasoning paths in parallel and selecting the most promising

### Self-Consistency
- **Paper:** "Self-Consistency Improves Chain of Thought Reasoning in Language Models" (Wang et al., 2022)
- **Key idea:** Generating multiple responses and selecting the most consistent one
