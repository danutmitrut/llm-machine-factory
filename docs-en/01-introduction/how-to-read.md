# How to read this guide

## Three paths through the material

### Path 1: I want to use it NOW (5 minutes)

1. Go directly to [Factory Machines](../03-factory-machines/overview.md)
2. Choose the right machine for your task
3. Copy the metaprompt
4. Paste it into Claude/GPT
5. Follow the instructions

**Available machines:**
- [Solutions Architect](../03-factory-machines/solutions-architect.md) - for solving complex problems
- [Veracity Auditor](../03-factory-machines/veracity-auditor.md) - for verifying information
- [AIM](../02-aim-core/aim-complete.md) - for building new machines

---

### Path 2: I want to understand how it works (30 minutes)

1. Read [What are Metacognitive Machines?](what-are-machines.md)
2. Read [Why more than prompts?](why-more-than-prompts.md)
3. Explore [How AIM works](../02-aim-core/how-it-works.md)
4. See [How to combine them](../03-factory-machines/combining-machines.md)
5. Test with a machine of your choice

---

### Path 3: I want the complete story (1-2 hours)

1. Start with the Introduction (this chapter)
2. Go through AIM in detail
3. Study each factory machine
4. Read [Project History](../04-project-history/evolution.md) - how it was built
5. Deepen with the [Advanced Guide](../05-usage-guide/advanced.md)

## Conventions used

### Code blocks = Metaprompts or examples

```
**[Start Metaprompt]**
Instructions for AI...
**[End Metaprompt]**
```

These are copy-paste ready.

### Tables = Comparisons

| Concept A | Concept B |
|-----------|-----------|
| Difference | Difference |

### Text diagrams = Flows

```
Input → Processing → Output
           ↓
       Verification
```

### Emojis = We don't use them

Documentation is professional and clear, without decorations.

## Key terms

If you encounter an unknown term, check the [Glossary](../06-reference/glossary.md).

**Essential terms:**
- **Metaprompt** - a prompt that generates or controls other prompts
- **LLM Machine** - informal term for a complex metaprompt
- **Iteration** - a complete cycle of internal question-answer
- **Synchronization point** - moment of dialogue with user
- **Cognitive continuity** - principle of authentic sequential reasoning

---

## How to test

1. **Choose a machine** from this guide
2. **Copy the complete metaprompt** (between `[Start...]` and `[End...]`)
3. **Open Claude or GPT** (works with both)
4. **Paste the metaprompt** as first message
5. **Enter your problem** when asked
6. **Watch the process** - you'll see thinking iterations
7. **Respond to syncs** when they appear
